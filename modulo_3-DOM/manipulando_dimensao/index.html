        SHREK
        Once upon a time there was a lovely 
        princess. But she had an enchantment 
        upon her of a fearful sort which could 
        only be broken by love's first kiss. 
        She was locked away in a castle guarded 
        by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
        Many brave knights had attempted to 
        free her from this dreadful prison, 
        but non prevailed. She waited in the 
        dragon's keep in the highest room of 
        the tallest tower for her true love 
        and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
        Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
        a load of - (toilet flush)
        Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
        day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
        after the ogre.
        NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME
        MAN1
        Think it's in there?
        MAN2
        All right. Let's get it!
        MAN1
        Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
        thing can do to you?
        MAN3
        Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
        bread.
        Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
        SHREK
        Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
        giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
        They'll make a suit from your freshly 
        peeled skin.
